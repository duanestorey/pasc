# Testing

One of the issues I see many people with long covid19 experience is their inability to convince doctors of their problems. Many lab tests will show variations for PASC, often in terms of the lymphocyte or cytokine profiles. But these labs aren't routinely ordered by doctors, many of which simply rely on CRP or other markers as proxies for any systemic issues. 

Here is a listing of private laboratories around the world with tests that may help diagnose or track their condition.

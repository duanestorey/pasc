Some of the latest research and clinical trials for PASC.

1. RNA Sequencing via [Amatica Health](https://www.amaticahealth.com/me-cfs-long-covid-rna-sequencing-test/)

Join a group of individuals testing their blood for up to 20,000 gene expressions that may help determine what exactly is PASC and open up avenues to treat it.  Included in this research effort are:

- Comprehensive RNA sequencing analysis capturing ~20,000 gene expressions
- AI/ML platform processing of 350+ personal health data points
- Research insights across ~1,500 biological pathways
- Generation of transcriptomic profile and personalised report
